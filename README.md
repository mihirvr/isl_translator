# ISL (Indian Sign Language) Translator

A real-time Indian Sign Language recognition system that uses computer vision and machine learning to translate hand gestures into text and speech. This project supports 5 basic ISL gestures and provides both command-line and GUI interfaces for gesture recognition.

## 🎯 Features

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition**: Uses MediaPipe for accurate hand landmark detection
- **Machine Learning Classification**: Random Forest classifier for gesture prediction
- **Text-to-Speech Output**: Audible feedback using pyttsx3
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Command-line and GUI applications
- **Data Collection Tool**: Easy dataset creation for training
- **Standalone Executable**: PyInstaller build configuration for distribution

## 🚀 Supported Gestures

The system currently recognizes 5 basic ISL gestures:
- **Hello** - Greeting gesture
- **Sorry** - Apology gesture  
- **Thank You** - Gratitude gesture
- **Yes** - Affirmative gesture
- **No** - Negative gesture

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Webcam/Camera for gesture capture
- Windows/macOS/Linux

### Required Dependencies

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
pip install scikit-learn
pip install numpy
pip install pyttsx3
pip install pillow
pip install pyinstaller  # Optional: for building executable
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd isl_translator
```

## 🎮 Usage

### 1. Data Collection (Optional - if you want to retrain)

If you want to collect your own training data or add new gestures:

```bash
python collect_data.py
```

- Follow the on-screen prompts
- Press ENTER to start recording each gesture
- Perform the gesture for 3 seconds (30 frames captured)
- Press 'q' to stop recording manually

### 2. Model Training (Optional - if you collected new data)

To train the model with your collected data:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will:
- Load all gesture data from the `dataset/` folder
- Train a Random Forest classifier
- Save the model as `model.pkl`
- Generate `gestures.txt` with gesture labels

### 3. Real-time Recognition

#### Command Line Interface

```bash
python recognize_sign.py
```

- Shows live video feed with hand landmarks
- Displays detected gesture on screen
- Press 'q' to quit

#### GUI Interface (Recommended)

```bash
python gui_recognizer.py
```

- User-friendly graphical interface
- Live video preview
- Text display of detected gestures
- **Voice output** - speaks detected gestures
- Includes prediction debouncing for stability

### 4. Building Standalone Executable

To create a standalone executable:

```bash
pyinstaller gui_recognizer.spec
```

The executable will be created in the `dist/` folder.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Hand Landmark Detection
- Uses **MediaPipe Hands** to detect 21 hand landmarks
- Extracts X, Y, Z coordinates for each landmark (63 features total)
- Works with single hand detection for optimal performance

### 2. Feature Extraction
- Normalizes hand landmarks to camera frame
- Creates feature vector of 63 dimensions (21 landmarks × 3 coordinates)
- Real-time processing at ~30 FPS

### 3. Machine Learning Classification
- **Random Forest Classifier** with 100 estimators
- Trained on collected gesture samples
- Provides confidence-based predictions

### 4. Prediction Stabilization
- Implements prediction history with deque buffer
- Requires consistent predictions before triggering voice output
- Prevents false positives and stuttering

## 📊 Technical Specifications

- **Computer Vision**: MediaPipe Hands v0.8+
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn Random Forest
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter
- **Voice Synthesis**: pyttsx3
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV
- **Data Format**: NumPy arrays (.npy files)

## 🎯 Performance

- **Accuracy**: ~90-95% on well-lit conditions
- **Latency**: <50ms prediction time
- **FPS**: 30 frames per second
- **Hardware**: Works with standard USB webcams

## 🔧 Configuration

### Gesture Collection Settings

In `collect_data.py`:
```python
FRAMES_PER_GESTURE = 30  # Number of frames per gesture
GESTURES = ['hello', 'sorry', 'thankyou', 'yes', 'no']  # Gesture list
```

### Model Parameters

In `train_model.py`:
```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)  # Adjust estimators
```

### Recognition Settings

In `gui_recognizer.py`:
```python
prediction_history = deque(maxlen=5)  # Prediction buffer size
# Requires 3+ consistent predictions for voice output
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera not detected**
   - Check webcam connection
   - Try changing camera index in `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` to `cv2.VideoCapture(1)`

2. **Poor recognition accuracy**
   - Ensure good lighting conditions
   - Keep hand clearly visible in frame
   - Collect more training data for problematic gestures

3. **Voice output not working**
   - Check if pyttsx3 is properly installed
   - Verify system audio settings
   - Try different TTS voices if available

4. **Import errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check Python version compatibility

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement gesture sequences and sentences
- [ ] Add gesture confidence scoring
- [ ] Support for two-handed gestures
- [ ] Mobile app development
- [ ] Real-time translation to multiple languages
